# Elevator Design Interface 

#issues with the current elevator design
1.	The numbering system is confusing, so I conducted a research asking residents in the apartment what they didn’t like about the elevator   most resident didn’t like the way the elevator interface is numbered
2.	Unnecessary space in the interface that almost looks like a button but, just a metal spacing .

3.The Interface button that controls the opening and closing of the elevator doors needs to be specific and simple rather it uses symbols  or signs that is not easy to use
